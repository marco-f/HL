A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for controlling **CNC or laser machines** from the browser using the **Web Serial API**. 
It allows users to draw, process images, generate G-code, and communicate with controllers â€“ directly in Google Chrome, with full offline support.

HobbyLASER is aimed at users of CNC machines, engravers, and plottersâ€”particularly self-built or budget models. It was developed to fill the gap between the basic software offered by low-cost machine manufacturers and professional software solutions, with a focus on hobby use and rapid prototyping.

It should be considered a constant work in progress, but thanks to its nature as a Progressive Web App (PWA), updates are available immediately upon release.
Currently, it can import text-based files with the following extensions: .svg, .dxf, .gcode, .nc, and raster images in .png, .jpg, or .jpeg format. The .svg format is an open standard, but only single-path drawings using absolute commands are accepted. For example, a file exported from Inkscape will be rejected if it contains multiple paths, groups, or uses relative commands.

### Features

* **Interactive Drawing** â€“ Create vector designs directly in the browser. Supports polyline, primitives, boolean and transformation operations.
* **Import/Export** â€“ Support for SVG and DXF files.
* **Advanced Text Paths** â€“ Generate text paths with proper handling of letter holes and micro-junctions.
* **Image Manipulation** â€“ Resize, rotate, translate, adjust gamma, dithering, halftone, crop, and convert to vector.
* **Customizable G-code Generation** â€“ Set laser power, speed, passes, air assist, and more.
* **3D Preview & Simulation** â€“ Real-time visualization of cutting paths.
* **File & Cache Management** â€“ Save G-code files locally with IndexedDB.
* **GRBL Control** â€“ Connect, send commands, stop, pause, resume, read status, handle errors, and estimate job time.
* **Offline & PWA** â€“ Work offline and install the app like a native app.
* **Dark Mode Ready** â€“ Optimized for low-light environments.

### SVG, G-code & Image Manipulation

1. **SVG & Vectors**

   * Create and edit polylines, rectangles, circles, and other primitives.
   * Boolean operations (union, difference, intersection).
   * Geometric transformations: scale, rotate, translate, mirror, offset.

2. **Text**

   * Convert text to vector paths.
   * Manage internal letter holes (e.g., "o", "a", "e").

3. **Images**

   * Transform: resize, rotate, translate.
   * Process: dithering, halftone, crop, vector conversion.

4. **G-code**

   * Custom parameters: power, speed, passes, air assist ...
   * Creation of micro joints, pattern fillings.
   * Real-time 3D preview and simulation.
   * File saving in local cache (IndexedDB).

5. **GRBL Control**

   * Connection and command sending via Web Serial API.
   * Stop, pause, resume functionality.
   * Monitor machine status, error handling, and time estimation.

### Web Serial API

This app uses the **Chrome Web Serial API** to communicate with CNC/laser controllers via serial connection.

* Access to serial ports from the browser
* Configure baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits
* Asynchronous read/write via Streams API
* Detects connect/disconnect events
* Requires **user permission**
* Works in **Chromium-based browsers only**

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marco-f/HLgit
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd HL
   ```
3. Run a local web server (e.g., with http-server):

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server
   ```
4. Open your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
5. (Optional) Install the app as a PWA via the browser install prompt.
